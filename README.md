# MCParodyLauncher

Minecraft Parody Launcher (a.k.a Minecraft 2-4 The Trilogy Definitive Edition Launcher) is a launcher for the games Minecraft 2, Minecraft 2 Remake, Minecraft 3, and eventually Minecraft 4.  
  
It originally started as a joke, but I wanted to start learning code anyway, so here we are.
